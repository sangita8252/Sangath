  Scenario: Completing a patientform second time
    When I log in as "teacher"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Course patientform"
    And I click on "Edit questions" "link" in the "[role=main]" "css_element"
    And I add a "Short text answer" question to the patientform with:
      | Question                    | first      |
      | Label                       | shorttext1 |
      | Maximum characters accepted | 200        |
    And I add a page break to the patientform
    And I add a "Short text answer" question to the patientform with:
      | Question                    | second     |
      | Label                       | shorttext2 |
      | Maximum characters accepted | 200        |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "user1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Course patientform"
    And I follow "Answer the questions..."
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | first | 111 |
    And I press "Next"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | second | 222 |
    And I press "Submit your answers"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "user1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Course patientform"
    And I follow "Answer the questions..."
    Then the field "first" matches value "111"
    And I press "Next"
    And the field "second" matches value "222"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | second | 333 |
